## Rock Paper Scissors

This is the first game I got to create all by myself. The interface is quite simple, fun and responsive. Here you can play the game against the compuper, and the first player to reach 5 points win the game. You can restart the game by clicking a button provided at the end of each game. The part that took the most time was surely designing the UI which I am satisfied with. Thank you for visiting!
